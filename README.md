# Convexus

## **Introduction**

Convexus introduces concentrated liquidity, giving individual liquidity providers (LPs) granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against. Multiple fee tiers will be baked into the protocol allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk.

Convexus empowers developers, LPs and traders to participate in a financial marketplace that is open and accessible to all.

These features make Convexus a flexible and efficient automated market maker:

- LPs can provide liquidity with more capital efficiency, earning higher returns on their capital through more frequent trades and associated fees.
- This capital efficiency will pave the way for low-slippage trade execution that could surpass the liquidity of both centralized exchanges and stablecoin-focused automated market makers such as Curve.
- LPs can significantly increase their exposure to preferred assets and reduce their downside risk.
- LPs can also sell one asset for another by adding liquidity to a price range entirely above or below the market price, similar to a limit order on an exchange, while also earning the trade fees for that trade.
